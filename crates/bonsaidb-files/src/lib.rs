//! Large file storage support for BonsaiDb.
//!
//! This crate provides support for storing large files in
//! [BonsaiDb](https://bonsaidb.io/). While BonsaiDb's document size limit is 4
//! gigabytes, the requirement that each document is loaded in memory fully can
//! cause higher memory usage when storing larger files.
//!
//! # `FileConfig`
//!
//! The [`FileConfig`] trait allows customizing the [`CollectionName`]s and
//! block size. If you want to use smaller or larger blocks, you can. If you
//! want to store more than one set of files in the same database, you can use
//! two [`FileConfig`] implementors with different [`CollectionName`]s.
//!
//! For most users, the provided implementation [`BonsaiFiles`] will work for
//! them.
//!
//! # Basic Example
//!
//! ```rust
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/basic-files.rs")]
//! ```
//! 
//! # Async Support
//!
//! This crate adds implementations of `tokio::io::AsyncRead` and
//! `tokio::io::AsyncWrite` when the `async` feature flag is enabled.
//! ```rust
#![cfg_attr(feature = "async", doc = include_str!("../examples/basic-files-async.rs"))]
//! ```
